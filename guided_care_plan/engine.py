"""
Guided Care Plan flow (engine)
------------------------------

Responsibilities:
- Orchestrates the multi-step questionnaire (step 0..N)
- Stores answers into st.session_state.care_context
- Computes normalized / derived flags used by later planners
- Renders a light-weight recommendation preview

Notes:
- Step 0's welcome hero is rendered in app.py (on purpose) to keep this module
  concerned only with the assessment flow and data/flags.
- The Back/Next controls are placed inside a custom <div class="scn-nav-inline">
  so CSS can keep them side-by-side on desktop AND mobile (until ~420px).
